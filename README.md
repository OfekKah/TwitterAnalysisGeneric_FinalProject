# Social Network Group Analysis Package

This project is a Generic Social Network Group Analysis Package implemented in Python. It allows for the analysis of group interactions on social networks, focusing on:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Sentiment and Emotion Analysis
- Topic Modeling

The package is designed to process and analyze data efficiently, offering a robust foundation for understanding group behavior, key themes, and sentiment distribution.

## Features

1. **EDA**:
   - **Analysis of Social Network Data**:
      - Accepts a database containing `authors` and `posts` tables.
      - Performs population-specific analysis if the `label` column exists in the `authors` table.
   - **Location Analysis**:
      - Extracts country information using the Llama model from the `location` column in the `authors` table.
2. **Sentiment and Emotion Analysis**:
   - Detects emotions and sentiment polarity (positive/negative/neutral) within tweets or posts.
   - Supports popular sentiment analysis libraries/models (e.g., Vader, TextBlob, or pre-trained transformers).
3. **Topic Modeling**:
   - Extracts the main themes from social network group posts using techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
**Database Requirements**
The database must include the following:

- **Posts Table**:
   Columns: author, date.
- **Authors Table**:
   Columns: friends_count, followers_count, statuses_count, location.
   Optional: label column for group-based analysis.

## Outputs

1. **EDA**:
   The following outputs are generated by the script:
   - **PNG Graphs**:
      When analyzing more than one population, the following graphs are created and saved as PNG files:
      **For each population**
      - Population_X_followers_count_range
      - Population_X_friends_count_range
      - Population_X_statuses_count_range
      - Population_X_top_authors
      - Population_X_tweet_distribution
      
      **Multi-Population Comparative Graphs**
      - Followers_Count_vs_Posts_Count_for_All_Groups
      - Friends_Count_Range_Merged
      - Posts_Count_Range_Merged
      - Tweet_Distribution_by_Month_for_All_Groups
    
       When analyzing one population, the following graphs are created and saved as PNG files:
      .......................................
   - **Summary Statistics**:
     A CSV file named summary_statistics.csv, containing aggregated statistics for the following columns:
      - friends_count
      - followers_count
      - statuses_count
