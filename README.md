# Social Network Group Analysis Package

This project provides a generic exploratory data analysis (EDA) tool designed for analyzing social network data for different groups of authors and their posts.

---

## Features

1. **Analysis of Social Network Data**:
   - Accepts a database containing `authors` and `posts` tables.
   - Performs population-specific analysis if the `label` column exists in the `authors` table.

2. **Output**:
   - Generates PNG graphs for the analyzed data.
   - Produces a CSV file with summary statistics for `friends_count`, `followers_count`, and `statuses_count`.

3. **Graphical Analysis**:
   - For more than one population, graphs include:
     - Doctor-related data (e.g., follower counts, tweet distribution).
     - Nurse-related data (e.g., statuses count, tweet distribution).
     - Comparative visuals such as `Followers_Count_vs_Posts_Count_for_All_Groups` and merged ranges.

4. **Location Analysis**:
   - Extracts country information using the Llama model from the `location` column in the `authors` table.

## Requirements

To install all required dependencies, use the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage
**Database Requirements**
The database must include the following:

- **Posts Table**:
   Columns: author, date.
- **Authors Table**:
   Columns: friends_count, followers_count, statuses_count, location.
   Optional: label column for group-based analysis.

## Outputs
The following outputs are generated by the script:

PNG Graphs:

Visual representations of the data for analysis.
Specific graphs are listed in the Graphs Generated section below.
Summary Statistics:

A CSV file named summary_statistics.csv, containing aggregated statistics for the following columns:
friends_count
followers_count
statuses_count

---

## Graphs Generated
When analyzing more than one population, the following graphs are created and saved as PNG files:
**For each population**
- Population_X_followers_count_range
- Population_X_friends_count_range
- Population_X_statuses_count_range
- Population_X_top_authors
- Population_X_tweet_distribution

**Multi-Population Comparative Graphs**
- Followers_Count_vs_Posts_Count_for_All_Groups
- Friends_Count_Range_Merged
- Posts_Count_Range_Merged
- Tweet_Distribution_by_Month_for_All_Groups
