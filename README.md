# Social Network Group Analysis Package

This project provides a generic exploratory data analysis (EDA) tool designed for analyzing social network data for different groups of authors and their posts.

---

## Features

1. **Analysis of Social Network Data**:
   - Accepts a database containing `authors` and `posts` tables.
   - Performs population-specific analysis if the `label` column exists in the `authors` table.

2. **Output**:
   - Generates PNG graphs for the analyzed data.
   - Produces a CSV file with summary statistics for `friends_count`, `followers_count`, and `statuses_count`.

3. **Graphical Analysis**:
   - For more than one population, graphs include:
     - Doctor-related data (e.g., follower counts, tweet distribution).
     - Nurse-related data (e.g., statuses count, tweet distribution).
     - Comparative visuals such as `Followers_Count_vs_Posts_Count_for_All_Groups` and merged ranges.

4. **Location Analysis**:
   - Extracts country information using the Llama model from the `location` column in the `authors` table.

Columns: author, date.
Authors Table:
Columns: friends_count, followers_count, statuses_count, location.
Optional: label column for group-based analysis.

PNG Graphs:

Visual representations of the data for analysis.
Specific graphs are listed in the Graphs Generated section below.
Summary Statistics:

A CSV file named summary_statistics.csv, containing aggregated statistics for the following columns:
friends_count
followers_count
statuses_count

## Graphs Generated
When analyzing more than one population, the following graphs are created and saved as PNG files:

Doctor-Related Graphs
doctor_followers_count_range
doctor_friends_count_range
doctor_statuses_count_range
doctor_top_authors
doctor_tweet_distribution
Nurse-Related Graphs
nurse_followers_count_range
nurse_friends_count_range
nurse_statuses_count_range
nurse_top_authors
nurse_tweet_distribution
Multi-Population Comparative Graphs
Followers_Count_vs_Posts_Count_for_All_Groups
Friends_Count_Range_Merged
Posts_Count_Range_Merged
Tweet_Distribution_by_Month_for_All_Groups
